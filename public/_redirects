# Netlify redirects configuration

# The following rule proxies requests to /proxy/* to the proxy endpoint specified in .env,
# removing the /proxy prefix. So, if the proxy is https://cds.epa.nsw.gov.au, a request
# to /proxy/CDSContainerSearchPage will be proxied to
# https://cds.epa.nsw.gov.au/CDSContainerSearchPage
# This is necessary to get around CORS issues when making a direct request in the browser.

/proxy/*  https://cds.epa.nsw.gov.au/:splat  200
