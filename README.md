â™» Quickly check if a container is eligible for the [NSW Return and Earn](https://returnandearn.org.au/) recycling program using the container's barcode.

This project is part of [#CreateWeekly](https://dev.to/josephuspaye/createweekly-create-something-new-publicly-every-week-in-2020-1nh9), my attempt to create something new publicly every week in 2020.

## Usage

Visit <https://canireturn.netlify.com> on our phone, tablet, or computer (phone or tablet preferably).

## How it works

When you enter a container's barcode, the app checks if it's elibible for return using the [eligible containers](https://returnandearn.org.au/how-it-works/containers/") database, which is available via the official [Return and Earn Container Search](https://cds.epa.nsw.gov.au/CDSContainerSearchPage) page.

The app also displays additional information about the container, such as the product's name, material type, and storage capacity.
